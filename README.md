# pentest-linux-privileges

##### borrowed via chousensha

##### Linux privilege checker #####

Searches for privileges, service settings, sensitive information, running
processes, installed programs, network statistics, logs and  various other information about the system.

Inspired from g0tm1lk's cheatsheet, available at http://blog.g0tmi1k.com/2011/08/basic-linux-privilege-escalation.html


NOTES

Full output may be excessive, I tried to break it down in specific functions to make it easy to check for relevant information only by commenting out the unnecessary bits.

It's using the subprocess module for running commands.

Running time may vary, with all checks enabled it took ~1min on a freshly installed Debian and ~4min on a custom Kali system.

DEMO

See text file for output.



Collection of network related scripts.
